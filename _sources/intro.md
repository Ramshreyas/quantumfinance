# Quantum Finance

My goal in writing this book is to teach myself **three awesome things** all at once:

1. Quantum mechanics (sort of)
2. Quantum computing
3. Quantitative finance

More specifically, we are going to rebuild the foundations of quantitative finance using Quantum Mechanics, or rather its associated mathematical formalisms, as the language, and Quantum Computing as the primary tool for computation. We are in fact going to pretend this is the world we live in - 'things' behave quantum-mechanically, and all computations is done on quantum computers.

Which also means I'm not going to reproduce yet another primer on any of these three awesome topics - the internet abounds with them, plus there's always chatGPT<X>. Actually, the only thing you really need as a prerequisite is very basic quantum computing - I will build up the finance parts from scratch. So you'll basically be good to go if you can understand everything in qiskit's [introductory tutorial](https://qiskit.org/documentation/tutorials/circuits/1_getting_started_with_qiskit.html). Good luck!

This thing is going to be all over the place at first, and I'll let it all play out in front of your eyes in public - mainly as an accountability mechanism (and a wee bit of self-aggrandizement).

Either way, I hope you enjoy it.

*NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE!*
